			<p>We now have all the pieces in place: layered AI models that can determine a customer’s intent and extract key metadata, integrations that can retrieve order status or track packages, and workflows that guide our chatbot in handling different customer issues. But there's one critical component left: the core application that ties everything together. This application is the brain behind the chatbot, interfacing between customers and our services to turn it into a fully functional customer service solution.</p>
<h3>Interfacing with Customers</h3>
<p>So how do we get customers to interact with our chatbot? As mentioned before, it’s rare for a company to build a customer service portal entirely from scratch. Most rely on existing helpdesk platforms like Zendesk, Freshdesk, or Salesforce, which come with well-documented APIs for integration. These helpdesks are where customers initiate their communication, whether through email, SMS, or live chat, and they become the gateway for our chatbot.</p>
<p>The entry point for our chatbot is through the helpdesk. This allows us to standardize customer interactions, no matter the medium. When a customer sends a message—whether it's via email, SMS, or a live chat window—the helpdesk notifies our application through an event or webhook. For example, when a customer submits a new email, the helpdesk system pings our core application with the relevant ticket ID and customer message.</p>
<p>At this point, the application steps in. It processes the message, determining if the chatbot can respond based on the customer’s intent and the available data. Within milliseconds, our system can either generate an appropriate response or, if necessary, pass the conversation to a human agent for more complex cases.</p>
<p>This notification system is a crucial interface, allowing the chatbot to work in tandem with the helpdesk. Every time a customer replies, the helpdesk notifies us again, providing a seamless flow of interaction. Additionally, the helpdesk API can tell us the communication channel the customer used—email, SMS, or chat—so we can tailor our responses accordingly. For example, an SMS may call for a shorter, more concise reply, ensuring that we don’t overwhelm the customer with a wall of text.</p>
<p>In essence, the helpdesk acts as the bridge between the customer and the chatbot, while the core application orchestrates the responses and actions that follow.</p>
<h3>Interfacing with our Services.</h3>

<h2>The Technical Architecture of a Chatbot</h2>
<p>To understand how a chatbot effectively serves customers, it’s important to break down its technical architecture. At the core of this system is the application, which orchestrates various components to ensure seamless interaction between the customer, the AI, and the underlying systems that support the business.</p>
<p><img src="./asset/images/chatbot.svg" alt="Chatbot Architecture" /></p>
<h3>The Application Core</h3>
<p>The application is the backbone of the chatbot, responsible for managing all interactions and ensuring that every customer query is handled efficiently and accurately. Within the application, several key components work together:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Company Policy Processor</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each customer intent—such as tracking an order, returning an item, or checking inventory—the application has a dedicated <strong>Company Policy Processor</strong>. This processor ensures that the chatbot’s responses are aligned with the company’s specific policies and commitments.</li>
<li>For example, if a customer wants to track an order, the policy processor will enforce the company’s shipping policy, checking if the order is within the processing time before providing a tracking update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integration Layer</strong>
<ul>
<li>The application connects to various systems through an <strong>Integration Layer</strong>. This layer ensures that the chatbot has access to real-time data and can execute actions based on customer requests. Key integrations include:
<ul>
<li><strong>eCommerce Platforms</strong> (e.g., Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce): These integrations allow the chatbot to retrieve order information, process returns, and update inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Helpdesk Software</strong> (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, Kustomer): These connections enable the chatbot to log support tickets, escalate issues, and track customer interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Carrier Services</strong> (e.g., USPS, UPS, FedEx): These integrations provide real-time shipping updates and tracking information, allowing the chatbot to inform customers about the status of their shipments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI Models</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>AI Models</strong> are managed and controlled by the application. These models serve specific functions within the chatbot’s workflow:
<ul>
<li><strong>Intent Classification:</strong> The AI determines what the customer wants, categorizing the request into specific intents like “track order” or “return item.”</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> The AI assesses the tone of the customer’s message to gauge whether the customer is satisfied, frustrated, or neutral. This helps tailor the response to the customer’s emotional state.</li>
<li><strong>Reason Extraction:</strong> The AI identifies underlying reasons for the customer’s request, such as the cause for a return, enabling more precise and relevant responses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While the AI models play a crucial role in interpreting customer input, the application ultimately manages these models. The AI helps identify what the customer wants and extracts key information, but the application and its integrated systems handle the actual processing and response.</p>
