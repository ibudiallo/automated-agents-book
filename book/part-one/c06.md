We now have all the pieces in place: layered AI models that can determine a customer’s intent and extract key metadata, integrations that can retrieve order status or track packages, and workflows that guide our chatbot in handling different customer issues. But there's one critical component left: the core application that ties everything together. This application is the brain behind the chatbot, interfacing between customers and our services to turn it into a fully functional customer service solution.

### Interfacing with Customers

So how do we get customers to interact with our chatbot? As mentioned before, it’s rare for a company to build a customer service portal entirely from scratch. Most rely on existing helpdesk platforms like Zendesk, Freshdesk, or Salesforce, which come with well-documented APIs for integration. These helpdesks are where customers initiate their communication, whether through email, SMS, or live chat, and they become the gateway for our chatbot.

The entry point for our chatbot is through the helpdesk. This allows us to standardize customer interactions, no matter the medium. When a customer sends a message—whether it's via email, SMS, or a live chat window—the helpdesk notifies our application through an event or webhook. For example, when a customer submits a new email, the helpdesk system pings our core application with the relevant ticket ID and customer message.

At this point, the application steps in. It processes the message, determining if the chatbot can respond based on the customer’s intent and the available data. Within milliseconds, our system can either generate an appropriate response or, if necessary, pass the conversation to a human agent for more complex cases.

This notification system is a crucial interface, allowing the chatbot to work in tandem with the helpdesk. Every time a customer replies, the helpdesk notifies us again, providing a seamless flow of interaction. Additionally, the helpdesk API can tell us the communication channel the customer used—email, SMS, or chat—so we can tailor our responses accordingly. For example, an SMS may call for a shorter, more concise reply, ensuring that we don’t overwhelm the customer with a wall of text.

In essence, the helpdesk acts as the bridge between the customer and the chatbot, while the core application orchestrates the responses and actions that follow.

### Interfacing with Our Services

Our services—the integration layer, the workflow system, and the AI models—form the backbone of the chatbot's functionality. Each of these components is designed as a modular service, allowing them to be easily upgraded, extended, or customized based on the specific needs of a business. This modularity ensures that our system can adapt to various client requirements without major overhauls.

For example, let’s say we onboard a client that uses a different eCommerce platform than we currently support. Adding this new platform to our chatbot’s capabilities would be straightforward, as long as the new system provides similar functionality, such as retrieving order statuses, canceling orders, or updating customer details. Our integration services are flexible and can be expanded to accommodate new platforms, ensuring that the chatbot continues to operate seamlessly across different systems.

Moreover, each client may have specific business rules that our chatbot must respect. For instance, a company might want to prevent the chatbot from automatically canceling orders, reserving that action solely for human agents. To support this, the eCommerce integration service must be able to enforce these rules at the service level, ensuring compliance with the client's policies without requiring manual intervention.

Additionally, each of our integration services often involves complex rules like rate limiting, throttling API requests, or handling authentication securely. Our core application should manage these complexities behind the scenes, ensuring that the end-user experience remains smooth and uninterrupted. The customer should never be aware of these background processes—whether it's waiting for an API response or authenticating a service connection—because the application is built to handle these seamlessly.

By structuring our integrations, workflow, and AI as modular, independent services, we give the chatbot flexibility and scalability. We can extend its capabilities, apply custom business rules, and integrate with new platforms without disrupting the core functionality, making it a future-proof solution for companies with evolving needs.


### An Admin Interface

To ensure that clients can fully leverage the chatbot’s capabilities, an intuitive admin dashboard is essential. This interface serves as a central hub where clients can gain insights into how the chatbot is resolving customer issues and configure its functionality according to their business needs.

One of the primary features of the admin interface should be the ability to set up which **Actions** the chatbot will support, such as tracking orders, processing returns, or handling inquiries about product availability. Clients should have control over the chatbot's workflows, configuring specific rules, branching logic, and the language it uses to communicate with customers. This customization ensures that the chatbot aligns with each client’s unique branding and customer service style.

A key function of this dashboard is **providing metrics** that give clients a clear picture of the chatbot’s performance. As discussed in Chapter Two, the main reason customers turn to a chatbot is often because the user interface has already failed them. In many ways, the chatbot is here to treat a symptom. By using metrics, we can better understand where customers are struggling and address the root cause before frustration escalates. For example, if metrics show that many users cannot find their order number, this could prompt the client to adjust their process, such as prominently displaying order numbers in confirmation emails. The dashboard could even provide **insights** into the most common issues the chatbot resolves, helping businesses anticipate problems and improve their overall user experience.

In addition to the client-facing dashboard, an **internal admin interface** would be crucial for managing the chatbot system as a whole. This internal admin would allow for operational control, such as putting the chatbot into maintenance mode without impacting client performance. It could also enable or disable new features as they are developed and rolled out. With this flexibility, internal teams can ensure smooth updates and maintenance while minimizing disruption to client operations.

By providing both client-facing and internal admin interfaces, we give businesses the tools to monitor and optimize their chatbot, while allowing for seamless management of the system’s broader architecture. The admin interface becomes not just a control center but a vital resource for continuous improvement and proactive customer service.
