# Why use a chatbot?

A common misconception when adopting chatbots is the belief that they can entirely replace human agents, leading to significant cost savings. This assumption often stems from the idea that a chatbot can handle any question, from mundane to complex, such as answering trivia like “What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?” However, this is misguided. Especially when it comes to eCommerce chatbots.

The reality is that a chatbot should not be seen as a complete replacement for human agents. They are a powerful tool that enhances your customer interaction capabilities. Companies don’t take 72 hours to respond to messages because they want to make customers wait. They do so because their agents are overwhelmed with a backlog of customer inquiries.

Here is what a chatbot can do for you:

1. Handling Repetitive Requests:
	* Chatbots are particularly effective at managing repetitive and straightforward customer inquiries, such as checking order statuses or answering questions about return policies. By automating these interactions, chatbots can significantly reduce the workload for human agents.
2. Clearing the Queue:
	* By taking care of routine inquiries, chatbots help clear the queue, ensuring that customers with more complicated issues aren’t left waiting for days. This leads to faster response times and improved customer satisfaction.
3. Providing Valuable Metadata:
	* Even when a chatbot isn’t equipped to fully resolve a complex issue, it can still provide valuable insights to human agents. For example, a chatbot might gather essential details about the customer’s problem, sentiment, and context before passing the case to a human agent.
	
In essence, the purpose of a chatbot is not to replace human interaction but to complement it. By handling the volume of simpler tasks, chatbots allow companies to provide better, faster service while freeing up human agents to tackle more challenging customer concerns. When used correctly, chatbots become an integral part of a comprehensive customer service strategy, enhancing the overall customer experience rather than detracting from it.
