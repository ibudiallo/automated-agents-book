# How do customers ask questions in the real world?

In a perfect world, customers will be clear and concise with their questions. But in the real world, customer service messages are often a jumble of thoughts and emotions, a sort of verbal diarrhea. Understandable, of course, because a happy customer does not send a customer support message. Angry customers will bury the lede.

I’ve read through enough customer service emails to know that there is no way an AI can handle 100% of requests. One example that stuck to me was a customer that simply wrote: “My husband is dead.” Nothing before, nothing after. What is it supposed to mean? How would you respond? The proper response of course is to cancel the subscription and send condolences. And do not include that retention script to offer a 10% discount if they stay.

Also customers make assumptions. For example, a customer that is browsing a product page for short pants will decide to ask a question. They will open the chat box and say, “do these come in blue?” The customer service agent on the other end, human or AI, has no clue what they are talking about.

These are all important things to consider when building a chatbot. However, the secret ingredient that makes a truly effective chatbot is integration. Integration with existing eCommerce workflows is crucial. Businesses rarely build from scratch, they often use platforms like shopify, magento, woocommerce. They use help desk software like Zendesk, Help Scout, or Salesforce. For retrieving real-time package data there are different carriers like UPS, USPS, Fedex. Integrating your chatbot with all these platforms is what allows your automated agent to actually answer questions and provide value.

While AI plays a critical role in understanding the customer’s message, it’s the seamless integration with these systems that allows the chatbot to deliver accurate and timely solutions.

Behind the chatbot is an application with many heads. This application has integration with several software, it can use AI to determine the context of a user generated message, and it can use these tools to make decisions based on different companies policies.
