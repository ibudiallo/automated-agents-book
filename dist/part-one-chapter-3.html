			<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>What is an eCommerce Platform</h2>
<p>In order to sell anything online, a retailer needs a software solution to manage their business online. These platforms include features like customer orders management, accounting, inventory, and much more. This software solution is an eCommerce Platform.</p>
<p>It’s rare for companies to build these platforms from scratch especially since there is a plethora of software available both paid and open source. Shopify is a popular one, although a large number of companies still use WooCommerce.</p>
<p>These platforms come with documented API that can be used to integrate with other software. 3rd party applications can connect to these API endpoints to interact with the platform programmatically.</p>
<h2>What is a Help Desk?</h2>
<p>A small business with a few customers can offer support via an email. The owner can login from time to time and see if a customer is having an issue. But as a business grows, it becomes necessary to have a team of agents to handle customer service. Using email becomes cumbersome to keep track of a customer and ensure that their issue is resolved. A help desk software can help a company manage customer inquiries and provide support.</p>
<p>Just like eCommerce, it’s rare for a company to build its own help desk. Instead they can use one of the several solutions available. Zendesk is a popular one. The help desk platform also comes with a documented api that can help third party applications connect and manage customer tickets as well. This becomes pretty handy for a chatbot.</p>
<h2>What is a Carrier?</h2>
<p>A carrier is any company that handles shipment of purchases. Some popular ones in the US are USPS, UPS and Fedex. When a product is shipped, it carries a tracking number that can be used to track the status of the package.</p>
<p>These companies offer online services for tracking the status of the package. These services are also available via API and can be used by third parties to access the status in real time. This comes in very handy for a chatbot to provide real time information back to customers.</p>
<h2>Using AI + Integration to resolve an issue</h2>
<p>Although everyone wants to wrap chatgpt into their application today, a well trained classifier should be more than enough for your customer service needs.</p>
<p>Customers can write for a variety of reasons, but those reasons are still limited. Tracking orders, returning items, declaring a missing item, canceling subscription, etc. As long as our AI model can classify customer messages into those buckets, we are set. And if our model can’t, all we need to do is collect enough of those messages and train a new model. Let’s work through an example.</p>
<h3>Case Study:</h3>
<p>A customer purchased a dress in an online store and hasn’t received it yet. It’s been a few days now and she is starting to worry. She sees the transaction on her credit card, but no information was sent to her. She writes a message through email to complain that she hasn't received any information about the dress, and wants to know if it has already been shipped.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the confirmation message was sent but it was caught in her spam folder. Or the transactional email system was down during her purchase, or some other unforeseen event. But our goal is to make sure she has the most up to date information about her order.</p>
<p>We need to make use of our integrations before we can even receive the email. Let’s say this company uses Shopify to sell online, they use Zendesk to handle customer service, and they use both USPS and Fedex for shipment depending on the customer’s location.</p>
<ol>
<li>When her email is sent, it is received by the help desk software Zendesk, and since we are integrated with zendesk, our application receives the message with all the metadata we need.</li>
<li>The application extracts the content of the email, cleans it up, and sends it to our AI for classification.</li>
<li>The AI will respond with the most likely classification of “Tracking Order”. Machine learning usually includes the confidence rate, we can choose a threshold we are comfortable with. For example, if it tells us it is 30% confident this is a Tracking Order, we may want to escalate this message to the next human agent. But let’s assume this one gives us 90% confidence, our application can start processing the Tracking Order script.</li>
<li>We can use the customer’s email address to find the most recent order. To do so, we use the integration with shopify to search for orders by email, and get the latest. We can look at the status of the order and check if there are any tracking numbers included.</li>
<li>If the tracking number is included, we can determine which carrier it belongs to, hopefully the eCommerce provides it, or we can deduce it by analyzing the format. USPS in this case.</li>
<li>We can then use our integration with USPS to get the latest tracking number status. We can use the tracking information returned to determine the type of response we will send to the customer.</li>
<li>Now that we have all this information, we can go through the company's policy, such as expected shipment time, take into account if there were any delays and craft the message. It’s tempting to use ChatGPT to generate a response, but it is just so unpredictable. A well crafted script can be just as effective and can remove surprises from the equation.</li>
<li>When we have our response, we can use the Zendesk integration to respond to the customer’s email.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the customer’s perspective, she sent an email, and got a response a few seconds later. She is happy to know that her shipment is on the way.</p>
<p>In this case the means of communication was email, but it could have been real time chat, or anything really. As long as there is an integration with the chat system, our chatbot just plays the role of a customer service agent and performs the exact same tasks in the background.</p>
<h2>The Technical Architecture of a Chatbot</h2>
<p>To understand how a chatbot effectively serves customers, it’s important to break down its technical architecture. At the core of this system is the application, which orchestrates various components to ensure seamless interaction between the customer, the AI, and the underlying systems that support the business.</p>
<p><img src="../asset/images/chatbot.svg" alt="Chatbot Architecture" /></p>
<h3>The Application Core</h3>
<p>The application is the backbone of the chatbot, responsible for managing all interactions and ensuring that every customer query is handled efficiently and accurately. Within the application, several key components work together:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Company Policy Processor</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each customer intent—such as tracking an order, returning an item, or checking inventory—the application has a dedicated <strong>Company Policy Processor</strong>. This processor ensures that the chatbot’s responses are aligned with the company’s specific policies and commitments.</li>
<li>For example, if a customer wants to track an order, the policy processor will enforce the company’s shipping policy, checking if the order is within the processing time before providing a tracking update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integration Layer</strong>
<ul>
<li>The application connects to various systems through an <strong>Integration Layer</strong>. This layer ensures that the chatbot has access to real-time data and can execute actions based on customer requests. Key integrations include:
<ul>
<li><strong>eCommerce Platforms</strong> (e.g., Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce): These integrations allow the chatbot to retrieve order information, process returns, and update inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Helpdesk Software</strong> (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, Kustomer): These connections enable the chatbot to log support tickets, escalate issues, and track customer interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Carrier Services</strong> (e.g., USPS, UPS, FedEx): These integrations provide real-time shipping updates and tracking information, allowing the chatbot to inform customers about the status of their shipments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI Models</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>AI Models</strong> are managed and controlled by the application. These models serve specific functions within the chatbot’s workflow:
<ul>
<li><strong>Intent Classification:</strong> The AI determines what the customer wants, categorizing the request into specific intents like “track order” or “return item.”</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> The AI assesses the tone of the customer’s message to gauge whether the customer is satisfied, frustrated, or neutral. This helps tailor the response to the customer’s emotional state.</li>
<li><strong>Reason Extraction:</strong> The AI identifies underlying reasons for the customer’s request, such as the cause for a return, enabling more precise and relevant responses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While the AI models play a crucial role in interpreting customer input, the application ultimately manages these models. The AI helps identify what the customer wants and extracts key information, but the application and its integrated systems handle the actual processing and response.</p>
