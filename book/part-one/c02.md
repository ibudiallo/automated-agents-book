## What is a customer?

A person asking “How tall is the Eiffel tower” is not a customer. For that they can use google or the many chatbots that try to cater to their needs.

A customer is a subset of a user that has narrow and specific needs. A customer has purchased an item from your store or plans to purchase an item. The questions that they ask will be limited to the context of their purchase or your product line. The answers they expect are also limited in that nature.

For example, if a customer is asking “Where is my package?” The only answer they expect will have to pertain to the status of their package.

A customer’s intention is not to have a conversation with your bot, but to find a solution to their problem. Your website has already failed them, and now they need support.

## Why do customers want to chat in the first place?

The simple answer is: because you have failed them.

I worked with a client that mostly received variations of the question: “Where is my order?” It should have been obvious what their problem was. The customer service agents had a ready-made script for tracking questions. The process was so repetitive that agents often mistakenly sent this tracking script to customers that had slightly different requests.

This situation highlights a fundamental issue: when customers feel the need to chat, it’s often because they couldn’t find the information they needed on their own. Instead of training agents to be more vigilant to these types of issues, the real solution was to improve the website's UX so that customers could access their order status easily. It makes no sense to have the order status 5 pages deep.

The perfect customer experience is one where they never have a need to contact you. Because your website provides the information they need right where they expect it to be.

## How do customers ask questions in the real world?

In a perfect world, customers will be clear and concise with their questions. But in the real world, customer service messages are often a jumble of thoughts and emotions, a sort of verbal diarrhea. Understandable, of course, because a happy customer does not send a customer support message. Angry customers will bury the lede.

I’ve read through enough customer service emails to know that there is no way an AI can handle 100% of requests. One example that stuck to me was a customer that simply wrote: “My husband is dead.” Nothing before, nothing after. What is it supposed to mean? How would you respond? The proper response of course is to cancel the subscription and send condolences. And do not include that retention script to offer a 10% discount if they stay.

Also customers make assumptions. For example, a customer that is browsing a product page for short pants will decide to ask a question. They will open the chat box and say, “do these come in blue?” The customer service agent on the other end, human or AI, has no clue what they are talking about.

### The Secret Sauce

If there is a punch line to this book, than let me make it clear and as early as possible. The secret ingredient that makes a truly effective chatbot is **Integration**. Integration with existing eCommerce workflows is crucial. Businesses rarely build from scratch, they often use platforms like shopify, magento, woocommerce. They use help desk software like Zendesk, Help Scout, or Salesforce. For retrieving real-time package data there are different carriers like UPS, USPS, Fedex. Integrating your chatbot with all these platforms is what allows your automated agent to actually answer questions and provide value.

While AI plays a critical role in understanding the customer’s message, it’s the seamless integration with these systems that allows the chatbot to deliver accurate and timely solutions.

Behind the chatbot is an application with many heads. This application has integration with several software, it can use AI to determine the context of a user generated message, and it can use these tools to make decisions based on different companies policies.
