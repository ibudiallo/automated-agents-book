## What is a customer?

Who are we building this system for? If you’re in eCommerce, the answer seems simple: it’s for your customers. But what exactly *is* a customer? It’s critical to define who this person is early in the process. Without this clarity, you risk creating a chatbot that caters to a user base that’s only superficially engaged or worse, wastes resources on interactions that don’t drive value to your business.

Let’s think about this. If someone visits your site and asks, "How tall is the Eiffel Tower?" Are they a customer? No. For that, they can use Google, or one of the many generalized chatbots floating around the web. Your eCommerce chatbot isn’t a trivia service, nor should it aspire to be. The real value comes from understanding that a *customer* is a distinct subset of all your users, with a very specific purpose in mind.

A customer has either already purchased something from your store or is on the path to doing so. This distinction is critical. Their needs are narrow, focused, and often time-sensitive. They might ask, "Where is my package?" or "What’s the return policy?" These questions aren’t meant to spark a long conversation or test your chatbot’s conversational skills. They’re seeking specific, actionable information. Information that is directly tied to their purchase, shipping details, or product inquiries.

For instance, when a customer asks, "Where is my package?" they don’t want to be led down a winding conversation path with a chatbot that tries to be too clever or versatile. They’re not interested in general shipping policies or engaging in small talk—they want to know exactly where their package is right now. If your bot answers with, “Your order is on its way and will arrive by [date],” then it has done its job. No more, no less.

A customer’s intent is rarely to *chat* with your bot, but to *find solutions to their problems*. This is where many chatbot systems fail. They assume the user wants a conversation when, in fact, the user is simply looking for a resolution. When a customer turns to your chatbot for help, it often means your website has already failed them. Maybe they couldn’t find the tracking information on their own, or they got lost in the maze of FAQs. At this point, they don’t want another hurdle, they want quick, useful answers.

Failing to recognize this basic but crucial distinction can lead to over-designing your chatbot, giving it features or functionality that don’t actually serve your core audience. The focus should always be on utility and speed. Chatbots are not about showing off the latest AI tech or trying to mimic human conversation. They are problem-solving tools, designed to address specific customer needs as efficiently as possible.

## Why do customers want to chat in the first place?

The simple answer is: because you have failed them.

I worked with a client that mostly received variations of the question: “Where is my order?” It should have been obvious what their problem was. The customer service agents had a ready-made script for tracking questions. The process was so repetitive that agents often mistakenly sent this tracking script to customers that had slightly different requests.

This situation highlights a fundamental issue: when customers feel the need to chat, it’s often because they couldn’t find the information they needed on their own. Instead of training agents to be more vigilant to these types of issues, the real solution was to improve the website's UX so that customers could access their order status easily. It makes no sense to have the order status 5 pages deep.

The perfect customer experience is one where they never have a need to contact you. Because your website provides the information they need right where they expect it to be.

## How do customers ask questions in the real world?

In a perfect world, customers will be clear and concise with their questions. But in the real world, customer service messages are often a jumble of thoughts and emotions, a sort of verbal diarrhea. Understandable, of course, because a happy customer does not send a customer support message. Angry customers will bury the lede.

I’ve read through enough customer service emails to know that there is no way an AI can handle 100% of requests. One example that stuck to me was a customer that simply wrote: “My husband is dead.” Nothing before, nothing after. What is it supposed to mean? How would you respond? The proper response of course is to cancel the subscription and send condolences. And do not include that retention script to offer a 10% discount if they stay.

Also customers make assumptions. For example, a customer that is browsing a product page for short pants will decide to ask a question. They will open the chat box and say, “do these come in blue?” The customer service agent on the other end, human or AI, has no clue what they are talking about.

### The Secret Sauce

If there is a punch line to this book, than let me make it clear and as early as possible. The secret ingredient that makes a truly effective chatbot is **Integration**. Integration with existing eCommerce workflows is crucial. Businesses rarely build from scratch, they often use platforms like shopify, magento, woocommerce. They use help desk software like Zendesk, Help Scout, or Salesforce. For retrieving real-time package data there are different carriers like UPS, USPS, Fedex. Integrating your chatbot with all these platforms is what allows your automated agent to actually answer questions and provide value.

While AI plays a critical role in understanding the customer’s message, it’s the seamless integration with these systems that allows the chatbot to deliver accurate and timely solutions.

Behind the chatbot is an application with many heads. This application has integration with several software, it can use AI to determine the context of a user generated message, and it can use these tools to make decisions based on different companies policies.
