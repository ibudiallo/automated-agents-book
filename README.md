# TODO:

- [x] Import the book in it's current state to github
- [x] Add a license
- [x] Update read me with clear section to explain how the book will be written
- [ ] Finalize the meta sections for each chapter. They seem random right now. Ex: Fun facts should better transition based on the chapter content.
- [ ] Add the table of content for Part three.
