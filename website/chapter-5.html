			<h2>What is company policy?</h2>
<p>With a chatbot that uses AI to extract context from user messages, integrates with various platforms, and addresses user problems, the final piece we need is a script to orchestrate this symphony.</p>
<p>Every eCommerce business operates under a set of policies that define how they interact with customers and fulfill their commitments. These policies are not just guidelines; they are promises made to customers, and they play a crucial role in how the company responds to customer inquiries.</p>
<p>For example, a company might have the following commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> All purchased items will be shipped within 2 business days.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA):</strong> Orders should arrive within 3 to 5 business days.</li>
<li><strong>Return Policy:</strong> Items can be returned, no questions asked, within 30 days of purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Refund/Replacement Policy:</strong> Damaged items reported within the first 10 days can be refunded or replaced. After 10 days, only replacements are offered.</li>
</ul>
<p>These policies are not part of the AI model’s training. Instead, they are implemented at the application level, as a manual process that ensures alignment with the specific policies of the company. This distinction is crucial because it underscores that the chatbot’s role is to apply these predefined rules consistently, rather than relying on the AI to make decisions based on generalized training data.</p>
<p>For instance, if a customer asks for tracking information 10 minutes after placing an order, the AI isn’t making an arbitrary decision. Instead, the application applies the company’s shipping policy: "Your order is currently being processed and should ship within 2 business days. Once it ships, you’ll receive an email with the tracking information."</p>
<p>By embedding company policies into the application’s logic, you ensure that customer interactions are consistent and aligned with your business's commitments. This process requires manual configuration to match the company’s specific rules and policies, ensuring that the chatbot’s responses are accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>These policies can be structured into a decision tree that guides the chatbot’s responses for different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order Status Inquiries:</strong> If a customer asks about their order before it’s shipped, the chatbot refers to the processing time. If it’s within the SLA window, the chatbot provides reassurance that the order is on track. If it’s beyond the SLA, the chatbot can escalate the issue or provide a more detailed explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Return Requests:</strong> When a customer requests a return within the allowed 30-day window, the chatbot can immediately initiate the return process. If the request comes after 30 days, the chatbot might offer alternative solutions, such as store credit or an exchange, based on the company’s policy.</li>
<li><strong>Refund or Replacement for Damaged Items:</strong> The chatbot can automatically check the date of the order and, if within the first 10 days, offer a refund or replacement. If it’s after 10 days, the chatbot follows the policy by offering only a replacement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating these policies into the chatbot at the application level, rather than through AI model training, not only ensures compliance but also enhances the customer experience by providing clear, consistent, and policy-driven responses. This reduces ambiguity, prevents potential disputes, and aligns the chatbot’s behavior with the company’s values and commitments.</p>
