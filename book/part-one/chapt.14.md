# The Technical Architecture of a Chatbot

To understand how a chatbot effectively serves customers, it’s important to break down its technical architecture. At the core of this system is the application, which orchestrates various components to ensure seamless interaction between the customer, the AI, and the underlying systems that support the business.

## The Application Core

The application is the backbone of the chatbot, responsible for managing all interactions and ensuring that every customer query is handled efficiently and accurately. Within the application, several key components work together:

1. **Company Policy Processor**
	* For each customer intent—such as tracking an order, returning an item, or checking inventory—the application has a dedicated **Company Policy Processor.** This processor ensures that the chatbot’s responses are aligned with the company’s specific policies and commitments.
	* For example, if a customer wants to track an order, the policy processor will enforce the company’s shipping policy, checking if the order is within the processing time before providing a tracking update.
2. **Integration Layer**
	* The application connects to various systems through an Integration Layer. This layer ensures that the chatbot has access to real-time data and can execute actions based on customer requests. Key integrations include:
	* * **eCommerce Platforms** (e.g., Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce): These integrations allow the chatbot to retrieve order information, process returns, and update inventory.
	* * **Helpdesk Software** (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, Kustomer): These connections enable the chatbot to log support tickets, escalate issues, and track customer interactions.
	* * **Carrier Services** (e.g., USPS, UPS, FedEx): These integrations provide real-time shipping updates and tracking information, allowing the chatbot to inform customers about the status of their shipments.
3. **AI Models**
	* The AI Models are managed and controlled by the application. These models serve specific functions within the chatbot’s workflow:
	* * **Intent Classification:** The AI determines what the customer wants, categorizing the request into specific intents like “track order” or “return item.”
	* * **Sentiment Analysis:** The AI assesses the tone of the customer’s message to gauge whether the customer is satisfied, frustrated, or neutral. This helps tailor the response to the customer’s emotional state.
	* * **Reason Extraction:** The AI identifies underlying reasons for the customer’s request, such as the cause for a return, enabling more precise and relevant responses.

While the AI models play a crucial role in interpreting customer input, the application ultimately manages these models. The AI helps identify what the customer wants and extracts key information, but the application and its integrated systems handle the actual processing and response.
