			<p>Watching the documentary startup.com I was struck by how one of the most challenging parts of the business was coming up with a catchy domain name. It was the 90s, we were at peak dotcom, and for the most part companies produced little to no value. But it was exciting. Sure, it is nice to have a cool domain name, but the real question should have been: what do you do as a business? In hindsight, that would have been the obvious question to ask. But while you waste time asking these “important” questions, other investors might seize the opportunity. You will miss your chance to be part of the internet boom. But what was the opportunity, really?</p>
<p>I felt the same way about chatbots. It became all the rage to add a chatbot to your website, even if it provided no real value. Would you be the hot new startup without a chatbot on your website in 2018? Why take the chance and miss out on this opportunity. Then again, in hindsight, we can ask “What opportunity?”</p>
<p>Much like how businesses once scrambled to secure catchy domain names without a clear purpose, many rushed to deploy chatbots without fully understanding their potential or limitations. I’ve seen my fair share of chatbots come and go. The hype was exaggerated, much like the AI bubble we are living through right now. I joined a small startup as the first engineer, and we built a chatbot. Or more accurately a customer service agent. By the time I left two years later, the startup had grown from 3 people to 40 employees. We had resolved tickets from millions of customers.</p>
<p>Now that we have the benefit of hindsight, what makes a good chatbot? How does it work? What are some of the assumptions that we left behind? If I were to build one today, what would it look like?</p>

<h3>How this book is structured</h3>
<p>This book will be split into three parts to cater to different audiences and provide a comprehensive understanding of chatbots in ecommerce.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Part one</strong> will offer a high level view designed to introduce terms and functions without technical intricacies. It covers essential concepts and practical insights into how chatbots function and their role in customer service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Part two</strong> will dive deeper into technical details. This portion will help readers with a technical background to turn around and build their own application that integrates all aspects of a chatbot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Part three</strong> will dive into how the principles and architecture behind eCommerce chatbots can be extended to other domains. Whether it’s virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant or chatbots specialized for different industries, the same foundational practices can be applied. This section will demonstrate how to leverage what you've learned to adapt your chatbot solution for a wide range of use cases, from general-purpose applications to field-specific implementations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By splitting the content this way, I want to provide a clear and accessible introduction to chatbots while also offering a technical analysis for those seeking a practical understanding.</p>
