# What is the purpose of your bot?

I’ve seen several videos of people demoing a chatbot by asking a factual question: How tall is the Eiffel Tower? Interesting and factual as it is, this is rarely why chatbots are needed in the first place. Without a clear purpose, there is no reason to deploy a chatbot on your website. The term “chatbot” itself can be misleading, as it suggests the primary function is to chat with users. In reality, the purpose of a chatbot is to resolve users’ issues efficiently. 

One clear purpose is within eCommerce. On an eCommerce website, customers expect quick responses and resolutions to their inquiries. However, the more popular the service, the harder it becomes to respond to individual customer issues in a timely manner. With limited resources a company can only hire so many customer service agents before it becomes a financial burden. I’ve seen companies that tell their customers to expect 48 to 72 hours for a response. This is where automation, like chatbots, comes into play.

By automating routine customer service interactions, chatbots can reduce wait times and offer faster resolution. I’ve often sent emails to customer support only to get a response 3 days later. By then the issue had already resolved itself, however a customer service agent still had to read through my complaint and try to figure out a solution. An automated customer service agent could have quickly provided a status to my order and I would have been happy.

The purpose of a chatbot is not to engage in endless conversations, but to provide solutions to customer problems. Identifying this purpose and integrating it early enough in your process is how you provide value to your users.
