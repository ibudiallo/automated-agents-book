				<p>Have you ever wondered how those chatbots in the bottom corner of your screen actually work? What about Siri, or Google Assistant? How do they understand and respond to you?
				<p>If these questions intrigue you, then this book is exactly what youâ€™ve been looking for.

				<p>This is the book I wish had existed before I began working on chatbots. As someone who was vaguely familiar with AI but unsure of where to start in building a tool to resolve customer issues, I often found myself navigating through scattered resources and hype. Now that the initial excitement around chatbots has subsided, it's still not easy to find comprehensive information about the components of an effective chatbot.</p>
<p>This book is my attempt to provide that missing guide, offering both technical and non-technical readers a clear path to understanding and building successful chatbot systems.</p>
