## What is a chatbot?

The term "chatterbot" was first coined in the 90s by Michael Mauldin, a computer scientist and creator of the Lycos search engine. It referred to any computer program that could simulate an interactive conversation with a human. Over time, this term was shortened to "chatbot." It’s understandable why we’d want to have conversations with our computers—they're incredibly powerful at performing tasks that we often find challenging. It’s tempting to turn to them and ask, “How do you do it?”

However, the term "chatbot" can be misleading. We often overlook the part of the definition that states it’s a simulation of a conversation. When you ask a chatbot, “What is your favorite pizza topping?” it will provide an answer because it’s programmed to do so. But what does it really mean for a computer to have a preference for pizza toppings?

I've seen many demos where people ask chatbots factual questions like, "How tall is the Eiffel Tower?" While interesting, this isn’t why chatbots are typically needed. Without a clear purpose, there's no reason to deploy a chatbot on your website. The term itself might suggest that its main function is to chat, but in reality, the goal of a chatbot is to resolve user issues efficiently. Imagine a computer that doesn’t actually solve any problems—what's the point?

One clear purpose for chatbots is within eCommerce. Customers on eCommerce websites expect quick responses and solutions to their inquiries. However, as a service becomes more popular, it becomes increasingly difficult to respond to each customer promptly. With limited resources, a company can only hire so many customer service agents before it becomes unsustainable. I've encountered companies that warn customers to expect a 48 to 72-hour wait for a response. This is where automation, like chatbots, can be invaluable.

By automating routine customer service interactions, chatbots can reduce wait times and offer faster resolutions. I've often sent emails to customer support, only to receive a response days later—by then, the issue had resolved itself, but a customer service agent still had to read my message and attempt a solution. An automated agent could have quickly provided an update on my order status, saving both time and resources.

The purpose of a chatbot is not to engage in endless conversations, but to provide solutions to customer problems. Identifying this purpose early in your process is key to delivering real value to your users.


## Why use a chatbot?

A common misconception when adopting chatbots is the belief that they can entirely replace human agents, leading to significant cost savings. This assumption often stems from the idea that a chatbot can handle any question, from mundane to complex, such as answering trivia like “What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?” However, this is misguided. Especially when it comes to eCommerce chatbots.

The reality is that a chatbot should not be seen as a complete replacement for human agents. They are a powerful tool that enhances your customer interaction capabilities. Companies don’t take 72 hours to respond to messages because they want to make customers wait. They do so because their agents are overwhelmed with a backlog of customer inquiries.

Here is what a chatbot can do for you:

1.	**Handling Repetitive Requests:**
	* Chatbots are particularly effective at managing repetitive and straightforward customer inquiries, such as checking order statuses or answering questions about return policies. By automating these interactions, chatbots can significantly reduce the workload for human agents.
2. **Clearing the Queue:**
	* By taking care of routine inquiries, chatbots help clear the queue, ensuring that customers with more complicated issues aren’t left waiting for days. This leads to faster response times and improved customer satisfaction.
3. **Providing Valuable Metadata:**
	* Even when a chatbot isn’t equipped to fully resolve a complex issue, it can still provide valuable insights to human agents. For example, a chatbot might gather essential details about the customer’s problem, sentiment, and context before passing the case to a human agent.
	
In essence, the purpose of a chatbot is not to replace human interaction but to complement it. By handling the volume of simpler tasks, chatbots allow companies to provide better, faster service while freeing up human agents to tackle more challenging customer concerns. When used correctly, chatbots become an integral part of a comprehensive customer service strategy, enhancing the overall customer experience rather than detracting from it.

## The role of AI in a chatbot

Up to now, I’ve avoided the term AI. But it’s important to acknowledge that chatbots are powered by AI, or machine learning to be more accurate. The common assumption is that chatbots follow a straightforward process. You set an application endpoint that prepares the user input then sends it to the AI. The AI understands the input then generates a response. Here the chatbot is essentially a thinly veiled wrapper around a sophisticated AI like ChatGPT. The idea is that you train the AI with company information and it becomes capable of answering customer questions seamlessly.

In this model, your application is merely a small REST endpoint, while the AI handles the heavy lifting. The chatbot is seen as the decision-maker and resolver of customer issues, providing immediate solutions based on its training. However, this assumption is incorrect, especially in the context of eCommerce. 

We could, in theory, build a chatbot without any AI by simply focusing on keywords that are common to the type of messages we expect from our audience. For example, if our customers frequently ask, "Where is my order?" we could write a script that looks for those words and responds with tracking information. For simple and repetitive queries, this could be perfectly fine—potentially handling around 10% of all messages. This approach alone would already be an improvement over having no automation at all.

However, this keyword-based approach comes with its limitations. While it might work for straightforward queries, it runs the risk of producing **false positives**, incorrectly responding to messages that contain the keywords but have an entirely different intent. For example, a message like, _"I want to cancel my order, but I don't know where my tracking number is,"_ may trigger the same response as "Where is my order?" even though the customer is requesting something entirely different. These false positives could lead to frustration and a poor user experience, undermining the very purpose of having a chatbot in the first place.

This is where AI comes in, allowing us to move beyond rigid keyword detection and into understanding the actual **intent** behind customer messages. By incorporating AI, the chatbot becomes more flexible, able to distinguish between different contexts and provide more accurate responses based on the user’s specific needs.
