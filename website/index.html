				<p>Have you ever wondered how those chatbots in the bottom corner of your screen actually work? What about Siri, or Google Assistant? How do they understand and respond to you?
				<p>If these questions intrigue you, then this book is exactly what you’ve been looking for.

			<div class="front-copy">
				<p>This is the book I wish had existed before I began working on chatbots. As someone who was vaguely familiar with AI but unsure of where to start in building a tool to resolve customer issues, I often found myself navigating through scattered resources and hype. Now that the initial excitement around chatbots has subsided, it's still not easy to find comprehensive information about the components of an effective chatbot.</p>
<p>This book is my attempt to provide that missing guide, offering both technical and non-technical readers a clear path to understanding and building successful chatbot systems.</p>

				<div class="about-self__content">
					<p>My name is Ibrahim Diallo. I got my first job fixing and setting up computers when I was just eleven years old. Understanding computers came naturally to me. That curiosity has followed me throughout my life. Today, I’m a software developer by trade and a hobbyist at heart.</p>

					<p>I learned about the theory of AI at a young age, but my first real-world experience with it was unforgettable. I was fired by a completely automated system. Despite my employer’s attempts to reverse the process, protocol dictated that security escort me from the building. The process was eventually undone, but the experience fueled my determination to understand AI more deeply.</p>

					<p>Since then, I’ve been immersed in the world of AI, creating countless tools that harness both machine power and human intelligence. Now, my goal is to share this knowledge with you.</p>
