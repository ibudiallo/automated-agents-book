# The role of AI in a chatbot

Up to now, I’ve avoided the term AI. But it’s important to acknowledge that chatbots are powered by AI, or machine learning to be more accurate. The common assumption is that chatbots follow a straightforward process. You set an application endpoint that prepares the user input then sends it to the AI. The AI understands the input then generates a response. Here the chatbot is essentially a thinly veiled wrapper around a sophisticated AI like ChatGPT. The idea is that you train the AI with company information and it becomes capable of answering customer questions seamlessly.

In this model, your application is merely a small REST endpoint, while the AI handles the heavy lifting. The chatbot is seen as the decision-maker and resolver of customer issues, providing immediate solutions based on its training.
