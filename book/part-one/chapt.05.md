# Why do customers want to chat in the first place?

The simple answer is: because you have failed them.

I worked with a client that mostly received variations of the question: “Where is my order?” It should have been obvious what their problem was. The customer service agents had a ready-made script for tracking questions. The process was so repetitive that agents often mistakenly sent this tracking script to customers that had slightly different requests.

This situation highlights a fundamental issue: when customers feel the need to chat, it’s often because they couldn’t find the information they needed on their own. Instead of training agents to be more vigilant to these types of issues, the real solution was to improve the website's UX so that customers could access their order status easily. It makes no sense to have the order status 5 pages deep.

The perfect customer experience is one where they never have a need to contact you. Because your website provides the information they need right where they expect it to be.
