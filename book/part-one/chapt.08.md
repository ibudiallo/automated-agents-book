# What is a Help Desk?

A small business with a few customers can offer support via an email. The owner can login from time to time and see if a customer is having an issue. But as a business grows, it becomes necessary to have a team of agents to handle customer service. Using email becomes cumbersome to keep track of a customer and ensure that their issue is resolved. A help desk software can help a company manage customer inquiries and provide support.

Just like eCommerce, itâ€™s rare for a company to build its own help desk. Instead they can use one of the several solutions available. Zendesk is a popular one. The help desk platform also comes with a documented api that can help third party applications connect and manage customer tickets as well. This becomes pretty handy for a chatbot.
