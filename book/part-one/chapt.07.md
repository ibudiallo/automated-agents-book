# What is an eCommerce Platform

In order to sell anything online, a retailer needs a software solution to manage their business online. These platforms include features like customer orders management, accounting, inventory, and much more. This software solution is an eCommerce Platform.

Itâ€™s rare for companies to build these platforms from scratch especially since there is a plethora of software available both paid and open source. Shopify is a popular one, although a large number of companies still use WooCommerce.

These platforms come with documented API that can be used to integrate with other software. 3rd party applications can connect to these API endpoints to interact with the platform programmatically.
