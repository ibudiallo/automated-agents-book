"The Expanse" is one of my favorite sci-fi shows. Set hundreds of years into the future, humanity has colonized the solar system, and space travel has become routine thanks to the fictional Epstein Drive. Technology is at its peak, yet one noticeable absence is a friendly, conversational robot.

I remember coming across a Reddit forum where people discussed the lack of AI in the series. This surprised me because I saw AI present in almost every scene. Not in the form of the familiar C-3PO, but rather as a tool. When characters encounter a problem requiring computation, they simply ask aloud, and the AI provides the solutionâ€”efficiently, without unnecessary conversation or personality. Yet, we often fail to recognize it as AI unless it speaks or exhibits a human-like demeanor.

To me, the true power of AI, or any computer, lies in its ability to solve problems. We may not be building space travel technology after reading this book, but at the very least, we can develop AI that functions similarly to those in The Expanse: When you have a question, you ask it, and it finds the solution.
