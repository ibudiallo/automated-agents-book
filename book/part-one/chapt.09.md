# What is a Carrier?

A carrier is any company that handles shipment of purchases. Some popular ones in the US are USPS, UPS and Fedex. When a product is shipped, it carries a tracking number that can be used to track the status of the package.

These companies offer online services for tracking the status of the package. These services are also available via API and can be used by third parties to access the status in real time. This comes in very handy for a chatbot to provide real time information back to customers.
