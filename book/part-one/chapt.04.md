# What is a customer?

A person asking “How tall is the Eiffel tower” is not a customer. For that they can use google or the many chatbots that try to cater to their needs.

A customer is a subset of a user that has narrow and specific needs. A customer has purchased an item from your store or plans to purchase an item. The questions that they ask will be limited to the context of their purchase or your product line. The answers they expect are also limited in that nature.

For example, if a customer is asking “Where is my package?” The only answer they expect will have to pertain to the status of their package.

A customer’s intention is not to have a conversation with your bot, but to find a solution to their problem. Your website has already failed them, and now they need support.
